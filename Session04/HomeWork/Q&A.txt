1. What are the main functional differences between a while and a for?
=> while: is a general looping statement.
   for:is designed for step through the items in a sequence or
other iterable object and running a block of code for each.

2. What’s the difference between break and continue?
=> break: exits a closest enclosing loop
   continue: Jumps to the top of the closest enclosing loop 

3. When is a loop’s else clause executed?

=> run once as the loop is exiting normally (without running into a break statement)

4. How can you code a counter-based loop in Python?
=> Counter loops can be coded with a while statement that keeps track of the index
manually, or with a for loop that uses the range built-in function to generate successive
integer offsets

5. What can a range be used for in a for loop?
=> The range built-in can be used in a for to implement a fixed number of repetitions,to change a list while stepping across it.
